The NABPR in conjunction with Mercer University Press is calling for proposals for the series, Perspectives on Baptist Identities. Proposals accepted for publication will be granted a $500 stipend upon completion of the manuscript. Authors will receive editorial and marketing support from both Mercer Press and NABPR. 

Please submit proposals for book length contributions to the series editors: Dr. João B. Chaves <jchaves@austinseminary.edu> and/or Dr. Kate Hanch <kate.e.hanch@gmail.com>. Either monograph proposals or promising collections of essays will be considered. The proposal should include:
