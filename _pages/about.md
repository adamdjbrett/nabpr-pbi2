The National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion is proud to join with Mercer University Press in the creation of the *Perspectives on Baptist Identities* academic book series. *Perspectives on Baptist Identities* explores the rapidly evolving questions of identity that press upon those who call themselves Baptist in the twenty-first century: What does it mean to be Baptist? What does the future hold for Baptists? How does the Baptist tradition relate to the global Church and other ecclesial traditions? How does Baptist identity impact Scripture reading and Christian practice? The series hopes to generate significant scholarly research and engender fruitful and lively conversation among various types of Baptists and non-Baptists.
