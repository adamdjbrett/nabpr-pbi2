Serving in theological education for nearly forty years, Rev. Dr. Molly T. Marshall believes she was put on the earth to love students, teach theology, guide spiritual formation, and challenge patriarchal structures that would hinder women from full acceptance in all forms of ministry. She has worked as a youth minister, campus minister, pastor, scholar, and theological educator, seeking to dismantle all forms of oppression.

After teaching for eleven years at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, KY, she joined the faculty at Central Baptist Theological Seminary in Kansas City, KS, where she served for twenty-five years, the last sixteen as President. Currently she is the President of United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities. Her great passion in life is spiritual midwifery as she encourages what she sees struggling to be born in the lives of those with whom she serves.

Part of her ministry has been expressed through writing, including blogs, scholarly articles, and opinion pieces. She has published thirteen books, most notably Joining the Dance: A Theology of the Spirit. She recently completed a theological commentary on the Thessalonian correspondence that was published in the BELIEF series August 30, 2022. Molly enjoys English choral music, tennis, walking, and cooking her world-renowned theological chili. Her special recipe for "Make Your Bed in Sheol" (the hottest of her repertoire) will revise your eschatology. No longer will you doubt that there is literal hell!
